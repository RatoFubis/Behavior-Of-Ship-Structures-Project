# Stability and Ship Behavior Project
## Overview
This project focuses on the design and analysis of the stability and ship behavior under two different loading conditions. For this we use a simplified bulk carrier design, using industry standart average measurements.

## Project Details
Methodology: Structural response in still water. Estimation of weight of ship and its contents. Distribution of weight of ship and water buoyancy. 
Statistical analysis of still water load effects in ship structures. Wave induced load. 
Analysis of primary ship hull girder stresses and deflections. Distribution of primary stresses. Distribution of combined stresses. Composite Construction. 
Modeling: 2d longitudinal and Midship diagrams
Analysis: load, shear forces and vertical bending moment
